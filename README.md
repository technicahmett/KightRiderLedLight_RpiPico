Make Knight Rider Led on the RaspberryPi Pico


Hi everbody. 

I have used Raspberry Pico and Micropython in this project. You know Pico. Pico is tiny and fast a MCU. But I won't tell you the Pico. You can find on internet If you want.

There are a few titles in this project. I wanted to share these titles when I was learning to Micropyhton.

- Blink led. Led on/off,
- use the potentiometer,
- use the TM1637 4 Digit 7 Segment Display,
- use HC-SR04 Distance sensor,
  Finally I put them all together.

Of course, I made coding on micropython. I used Thonny IDE.

Required equipments
1. Raspberry Pi Pico
2. Some leds, actually 10 pcs.
3. 1x potentiometer
4. TM1637
5. HC-SR04
